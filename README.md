# CMTF-model
"Development and Validation of a cross-modality tensor fusion prediction model based on the multi-modality MRI radiomics features and clinical radiological characteristics for microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma"

All MRI examinations were performed on 3.0T MRI scanners (GE Signa, GE 750W, Philips Ingenia, or Philips Elition) equipped with 8, 16, or 32-channel phased-array abdominal coils. Imaging sequences included: axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI, b = 800 sec/mmÂ²), axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging (T2WI-FS).

Preoperative MVI prediction can provide alternatives to pathological biopsy, assist doctors in developing personalized surgical treatment plans, and aid in evaluating prognosis. In this study, we developed and validated a novel CMTF model based on multi-modality MRI radiomics features and clinical radiological characteristics for predicting MVI in HCC patients. We evaluated the CMTF model and compared it with SM model and EF model, finding that the proposed CMTF model demonstrated superior predictive performance.
